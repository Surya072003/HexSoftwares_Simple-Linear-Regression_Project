# 🏡 Simple Linear Regression on California Housing Prices  
### ✨ HexSoftwares Internship – Data Science Project 2

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on applying **Simple Linear Regression** to predict housing prices using the **California Housing Dataset** from Scikit-Learn.

The goal is to explore the relationship between **Median Income (MedInc)** and **House Price (PRICE)** and build a predictive model.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn  

---

## 📊 Dataset Details
- Dataset: **California Housing Dataset**  
- Rows: 20,640  
- Columns: 8 features + target  
- Target: Median House Value  
- Feature used: **MedInc (Median Income)**

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset from sklearn  
2. Converted into DataFrame  
3. Performed exploratory analysis  
4. Selected feature: `MedInc`  
5. Split data into train-test sets  
6. Trained a Linear Regression model  
7. Predicted housing prices  
8. Evaluated model using MSE & R²  
9. Visualized actual vs predicted prices  

---

## 📈 Visualization
A scatter plot (actual prices) and a regression line (predicted prices) showing how income affects housing price.

---

## 📝 Insights
- Higher income → Higher house price  
- Model performs well with a reasonable R² score  
- Regression line clearly shows positive correlation  

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `LinearRegression_Housing.ipynb`
- `README.md`

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
Successfully built a simple regression model capable of predicting house prices based on income.  
This project demonstrates foundational Machine Learning and data analysis skills.
